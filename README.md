Welcome to DomCore v3.

You need to install the DomCore directory into your application somewhere accesible by your scripts to include the php .lib scripts.

Once the directory is installed, just call the needed scripts and build your code !

To do:
- more languages
- more examples temp, lang, datasources, cache
- patterns: observer, painter, pool, etc.
- check SHM object when the class into unserial of the SHM memory does not exists => error ? how to manage ?
   Note: autoload is NOT catchable when shm_get_mem launch it !
- check how to manage if there is no available shared memory and/or semaphores
- Windows (lack of) shared memory ?

To change the build:
  edit WADebug.lib at the beginning and change the version number
  change this file and add comments on new build.
